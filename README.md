https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer

Here is the project I code with this course.
Begin in 2023.02.16

## Week 1
Using HDL language,I had implemented 16 basic gate with the most elementary Nand.

finish in 2023.02.20

## Week 2
Using HDL language,I had implemented HalfAdder FullAdder ALU.

finish in 2023.02.22

## Week 3
Learn sequential logic to create RAM from bit to register using the basic component DFF.
finish in 2023.2.28

## Week 4
Learn the A and C instruction, and finish 2 project with the asm.
finish in 2023.3.18

## Week 5
Using ALU create a CPU
Using CPU,RAM,ROM create the Hack computer
finish in 2023.3.23

## Week 6
Complete the class,and creat the assembler for Hack Computer.
finish in 2023.3.25
